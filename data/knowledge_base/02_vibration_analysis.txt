WIND TURBINE VIBRATION ANALYSIS GUIDE
======================================

INTRODUCTION
============
Vibration monitoring is one of the most effective predictive maintenance tools for wind turbines. By analyzing vibration signatures, we can detect developing faults months before catastrophic failure, allowing for planned maintenance during low-wind periods.

VIBRATION MEASUREMENT BASICS
=============================

Measurement Units:
- Displacement: millimeters (mm) or mils (0.001 inch)
- Velocity: mm/s or inches/second (IPS)
- Acceleration: g (9.81 m/s²) or m/s²

Frequency Ranges:
- Low Frequency (0.1-10 Hz): Structural resonances, tower oscillations
- Medium Frequency (10-1000 Hz): Gear mesh, bearing defects
- High Frequency (1000-20000 Hz): Bearing impacts, early bearing faults

Measurement Locations:
- Main Bearing (low-speed side): Radial and axial
- Gearbox Input: Radial (horizontal and vertical)
- Gearbox Output: Radial (horizontal and vertical)

COMMON VIBRATION SIGNATURES
============================

1. BEARING DEFECTS
------------------

Inner Race Defect:
- Frequency: BPFI (Ball Pass Frequency Inner) = 5-7 × shaft speed
- Amplitude modulated by cage frequency
- High frequency acceleration spikes
- Sidebands spaced at shaft frequency
- Trend: Gradual increase over months

Outer Race Defect:
- Frequency: BPFO (Ball Pass Frequency Outer) = 3-4 × shaft speed
- Non-directional (constant amplitude)
- Less severe than inner race initially
- Easier to detect in time domain
- Trend: Can progress rapidly

Rolling Element Defect:
- Frequency: BSF (Ball Spin Frequency) = 2-3 × shaft speed
- Occurs twice per revolution
- Impacts on inner and outer race
- High frequency content
- Trend: Rapid progression once started

Cage Defect:
- Frequency: FTF (Fundamental Train Frequency) = 0.4-0.5 × shaft speed
- Low frequency, sub-synchronous
- Irregular impacts
- Often caused by improper installation
- Trend: Can be stable for long periods

Example Calculation (Main Bearing):
- Shaft Speed: 15 RPM = 0.25 Hz
- Number of Balls: 16
- BPFO = 0.4 × 16 × 0.25 = 1.6 Hz (96 CPM)
- BPFI = 0.6 × 16 × 0.25 = 2.4 Hz (144 CPM)
- BSF = 0.2 × 0.25 = 0.05 Hz (3 CPM)
- FTF = 0.4 × 0.25 = 0.1 Hz (6 CPM)

2. GEAR MESH FREQUENCIES
------------------------

Calculation:
GMF = Number of Teeth × Shaft Speed

Example (Three-Stage Gearbox):
- Low Speed Stage: 28 teeth × 15 RPM = 420 CPM (7 Hz)
- Intermediate Stage: 84 teeth × 60 RPM = 5,040 CPM (84 Hz)
- High Speed Stage: 21 teeth × 1,500 RPM = 31,500 CPM (525 Hz)

Healthy Gear Mesh:
- Single peak at GMF
- Low sidebands (< 20% of GMF amplitude)
- Harmonics at 2× and 3× GMF are normal but small

Gear Tooth Wear:
- Increased GMF amplitude
- Elevated sidebands around GMF
- Sidebands spaced at shaft frequency
- Action: Monitor, plan inspection within 3-6 months

Gear Tooth Crack:
- High amplitude impacts (time domain)
- Once per revolution (1×)
- Increasing with load
- Action: Immediate investigation required

Eccentric Gear:
- Modulation of GMF
- Sidebands at 1× shaft speed
- Both sides of GMF affected equally
- Action: Check shaft alignment, runout

Gear Backlash:
- Multiple harmonics of GMF
- "Grassy" spectrum (many small peaks)
- Metallic sound
- Action: Check gear mesh alignment

3. IMBALANCE
------------

Signature:
- Dominant peak at 1× running speed (1×)
- Primarily radial direction
- Phase difference of 180° across shaft
- Increases with speed (squared relationship)

Severity Classification:
- Minor: <1.0 mm/s at 1× - Monitor
- Moderate: 1.0-2.5 mm/s at 1× - Balance at next maintenance
- Severe: >2.5 mm/s at 1× - Balance soon, limit speed if possible

Causes:
- Blade mass difference (low-speed side)
- Rotor ice accumulation (asymmetric)
- Blade erosion (uneven)
- Manufacturing tolerances
- Coupling imbalance (high-speed side)

Correction:
- Blade balancing (add/remove weights)
- Replace worn blades
- Ice detection and heating
- Coupling replacement
- Dynamic balancing machine

Cost: $2,000-$8,000 depending on method and accessibility

4. MISALIGNMENT
---------------

Signature:
- High 2× running speed component
- Axial vibration elevated
- Phase difference across coupling
- May show 3× component if severe

Types:

Parallel Misalignment:
- High radial vibration at 2×
- 180° out of phase radially
- Action: Realign shaft/coupling

Angular Misalignment:
- High axial vibration at 1× and 2×
- Phase varies across coupling
- Action: Correct angular offset

Combination (most common):
- Both radial and axial elevated
- Multiple frequency components
- Requires precision alignment

Alignment Tolerances:
- Parallel offset: <0.05 mm (0.002")
- Angular offset: <0.05 mm/100mm (0.0005 in/in)
- Measurement: Dial indicators or laser alignment

5. LOOSENESS
------------

Mechanical Looseness:
- Multiple harmonics (2×, 3×, 4×, etc.)
- Non-synchronous peaks
- Changes with load
- Directional (worse in one axis)

Causes:
- Loose foundation bolts
- Worn bearings allowing play
- Loose housing or cover bolts
- Cracked structure
- Worn shaft fit

Detection:
- Impact testing
- Operating deflection shape analysis
- Visual inspection during shutdown

Correction:
- Torque all fasteners to specification
- Replace worn bearings
- Repair or replace damaged structure
- Use thread-locking compound

6. RESONANCE
------------

Characteristics:
- High vibration at specific speeds
- Rapid amplitude increase
- Multiple components excited
- Directional preference

Critical Speeds:
- First critical: Usually avoided by design
- Operating speed should be >20% away from critical
- Can shift due to wear or damage

Detection:
- Bump test (hammer test on shutdown unit)
- Coast-down analysis
- Run-up vibration recording

Mitigation:
- Change operating speed (if possible)
- Add damping
- Stiffen structure
- Mass changes (add or remove weight)
- Detuning

- Months 6-9: Slow increase (2.0 → 3.0 mm/s)
- Months 9-10: Moderate increase (3.0 → 5.0 mm/s) - PLAN REPAIR
- Months 10-11: Rapid increase (5.0 → 8.0 mm/s) - URGENT REPAIR
- Month 11+: Exponential growth → FAILURE

Lead Time:
- Bearing defect detected: 3-6 months to failure
- Gear tooth crack: 1-3 months to failure
- Misalignment: Can operate indefinitely but causes accelerated wear

BEST PRACTICES
==============

Do's:
✓ Establish baseline when equipment is known good
✓ Use consistent measurement points and techniques
✓ Measure in multiple directions (horizontal, vertical, axial)
✓ Record operating conditions with each measurement
✓ Trend data over time, don't rely on single measurement
✓ Investigate gradually increasing trends before they become critical
✓ Use time waveform for impact detection
✓ Compare to similar machines
✓ Train operators to recognize abnormal sounds
✓ Document all findings and actions

Don'ts:
✗ Don't rely solely on overall vibration level
✗ Don't ignore low-level increases
✗ Don't measure during transient conditions (startup, shutdown)
✗ Don't compare measurements from different sensor locations
✗ Don't assume high vibration means imminent failure without analysis
✗ Don't delay action on rapid increases
✗ Don't forget to update baselines after repairs
✗ Don't overlook low-frequency components
✗ Don't measure only when there's a problem
