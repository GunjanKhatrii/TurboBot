COMMON GEARBOX ISSUES
=====================

1. BEARING WEAR AND FAILURE
----------------------------
Symptoms:
- Temperature increase of 5-10°C above baseline
- Vibration frequency spikes at bearing defect frequencies
- Metallic particles in oil sample
- Unusual noise (rumbling, grinding)
- Increased oil consumption

Early Warning Signs:
- Temperature trending upward over 2-4 weeks
- Vibration levels increasing gradually
- Oil analysis shows elevated iron content (>100 ppm)
- Change in acoustic signature

Root Causes:
- Inadequate lubrication (30% of cases)
- Contamination (dirt, water, metal particles) (25% of cases)
- Overloading during high wind events (20% of cases)
- Manufacturing defects (15% of cases)
- Normal wear from age/usage (10% of cases)

Prevention:
- Maintain proper oil viscosity and cleanliness (ISO 4406 16/14/11 or better)
- Monitor bearing temperatures continuously
- Perform vibration analysis quarterly
- Keep oil topped up and free from water contamination (<500 ppm)
- Avoid operation during extreme wind conditions when possible

Repair Procedure:
- Shutdown and lock-out turbine
- Drain gearbox oil (capture for disposal/analysis)
- Remove gearbox from nacelle (requires crane, 4-6 hours)
- Disassemble gearbox in workshop
- Replace bearings (select proper tolerances and fits)
- Reassemble with new seals and gaskets
- Fill with fresh oil to specification
- Run-in period: 100 hours at reduced load
- Re-check oil sample after 50 hours

Cost Estimate: $15,000-$30,000 per bearing set + 5-7 days downtime

2. GEAR TOOTH DAMAGE
--------------------
Symptoms:
- Sudden increase in vibration amplitude
- Gear mesh frequency harmonics in vibration spectrum
- Large metallic particles in oil (>1mm)
- Loud clicking or knocking sounds
- Power output fluctuations

Types of Damage:
a) Pitting: Small craters on tooth surface
   - Cause: Contact fatigue, inadequate lubrication
   - Severity: Usually not critical if caught early

b) Spalling: Large sections of tooth surface breaking away
   - Cause: Advanced pitting, overload
   - Severity: Requires immediate attention

c) Scuffing: Adhesive wear, welding of surfaces
   - Cause: Loss of oil film, extreme pressure
   - Severity: Critical - leads to rapid failure

d) Cracking: Cracks at tooth root or surface
   - Cause: Fatigue, overload, material defects
   - Severity: Critical - can lead to tooth breakage

Detection Methods:
- Endoscopic inspection through inspection ports
- Oil analysis (particle counting and morphology)
- Vibration analysis (sidebands around gear mesh frequency)
- Acoustic monitoring (ultrasonic sensors)

Response Actions:
- Minor Pitting: Continue operation, increase monitoring frequency, plan repair within 3-6 months
- Moderate Pitting/Spalling: Reduce load to 70% rated, plan repair within 1 month
- Scuffing/Cracking: Immediate shutdown, emergency repair required

Repair Options:
- Re-machining: Only for minor damage, $5,000-$10,000
- Gear Replacement: $20,000-$50,000 per gear stage
- Complete Gearbox Replacement: $80,000-$200,000

Prevention:
- Maintain oil cleanliness (ISO 4406 15/13/10)
- Monitor torque loads and limit high-torque events
- Use synthetic oil with extreme pressure additives
- Proper run-in procedures after repairs
- Avoid frequent start-stop cycles

3. OIL DEGRADATION AND CONTAMINATION
-------------------------------------
Normal Oil Life: 24-36 months under ideal conditions

Oil Analysis Parameters:
- Viscosity at 40°C: 320 cSt (±10%)
- Water Content: <500 ppm (critical: >1000 ppm)
- Acid Number: <2.0 mg KOH/g (critical: >4.0)
- Iron (Fe): <100 ppm (critical: >200 ppm)
- Copper (Cu): <50 ppm (critical: >100 ppm)
- Particle Count (ISO 4406): 16/14/11 or better

Contamination Sources:
- Water ingress through seals or breather (most common)
- External contamination during oil changes
- Internal wear particle generation
- Oxidation and thermal degradation
- Additive depletion over time

Signs of Degraded Oil:
- Dark brown or black color (normal is amber/light brown)
- Milky appearance (water contamination)
- Burnt smell
- Increased viscosity (>350 cSt at 40°C)
- Failed acid number test

Actions Required:
- Water >1000 ppm: Immediate oil change or vacuum dehydration
- High metal content: Investigate source, increase monitoring
- High acid number: Oil change within 1 month
- Particle contamination: Install or service filtration system

Oil Change Procedure:
1. Warm up gearbox to 40°C (improves drainage)
2. Shutdown and lock-out turbine
3. Take final oil sample for records
4. Drain oil completely (use pump if necessary)
5. Flush with flushing oil if heavily contaminated
6. Replace filters and filter elements
7. Check breather and replace if needed
8. Inspect magnetic plugs for debris
9. Fill with new oil to correct level
10. Run gearbox for 1 hour at low load
11. Check for leaks
12. Take new oil sample after 50 hours

Oil Change Cost: $800-$1,500 including oil, filters, and labor

4. SEAL LEAKS
-------------
Common Leak Locations:
- Input shaft seal (low-speed side)
- Output shaft seal (high-speed side)
- Inspection port covers
- Oil level sight glass
- Drain plugs
- Breather assembly

Leak Severity Assessment:
- Minor Seepage: Few drops, no pooling - Monitor, repair at next scheduled maintenance
- Moderate Leak: Small puddle formation - Repair within 1-2 weeks
- Severe Leak: Continuous dripping, oil level dropping - Immediate repair required

Detection Methods:
- Visual inspection during routine visits
- Oil level monitoring (automatic or manual)
- UV dye testing for difficult-to-locate leaks
- Thermal imaging (cooler areas indicate evaporation)

Repair Procedure:
- Minor leaks: Clean area, apply thread sealant or gasket maker
- Seal replacement: Requires partial disassembly, 4-8 hours
- Major leaks: May require gearbox removal

Cost: $500-$3,000 depending on location and accessibility

Prevention:
- Use proper torque on fasteners
- Replace seals during any gearbox opening
