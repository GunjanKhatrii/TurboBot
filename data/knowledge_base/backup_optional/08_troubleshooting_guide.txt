      NO → Normal. Wait for higher winds.
      YES → Proceed to step 2

2. Check Turbine Status:
   ☐ What does SCADA show?
      "Standby" → Check for grid curtailment or manual stop
      "Fault" → Review alarm codes (see fault resolution section)
      "Running" → Proceed to step 3

3. Check Generator:
   ☐ Is generator spinning?
      NO → Check for mechanical brake engaged
           Check for pitch system issue (blades feathered)
      YES → Proceed to step 4

4. Check Electrical Connection:
   ☐ Is breaker closed?
      NO → Check why breaker is open
           Check for grid fault
           Check protection relay status
      YES → Proceed to step 5

5. Check Converter Status:
   ☐ Is converter running?
      NO → Check converter faults
