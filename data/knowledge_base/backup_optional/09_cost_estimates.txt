CONCLUSION
==========

Key Cost Management Principles:

✓ Invest in preventive maintenance (5-10× ROI)
✓ Implement condition monitoring (early detection saves money)
✓ Budget conservatively (plan for unexpected)
✓ Maintain spare parts inventory
✓ Optimize performance (small gains = big revenue)
✓ Track and analyze all costs
✓ Learn from failures
✓ Continuous improvement

Remember:
- Cheapest upfront ≠ lowest total cost
- Downtime costs often exceed repair costs
- Preventive maintenance pays for itself
- Quality work reduces repeat repairs
- Good data enables good decisions

The difference between good and poor O&M can be €500,000+ over turbine lifetime!
